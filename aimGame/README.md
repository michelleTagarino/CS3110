# Aim Game
This (boring) JavaFX game was created for an assignment in an Introduction to Computer Graphics course back in Fall 2015. The *aim* of the game is to shoot as many targets as possible. 100 points wins you the game, but if you run out of bullets before reaching that goal, you lose and it's Game Over.

## Let's Get You Started

In your terminal, cd into the **aimGame** directory:

	$ cd aimGame/

Compile the project:

	$ javac -d . *.java

Run the project:

	$ java aimgame.AimGame

### Prerequisites
	
	Java JDK 8

## Game Instructions

	Use your left and right arrow keys to position the cannon in the direction you want to shoot your bullets.

	Use your space bar to shoot the bullets.

	Hit the moving targets.

	Earn 100 points to win the game.

	If you lose all your bullets before getting 100 points, you lose.
