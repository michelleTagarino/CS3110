# Random Graphics
This JavaFX project involved a lot of math. Before jumping into this one, I thought I liked math. And I still do, but, I mean, this project really got me hating it. I still managed to get it finished though, because that's what being a computer science student is all about. Here it is.

- The first scene is a depiction of two red blocks moving back and forth across the window pane.
- The second scene is a depiction of the moon orbiting around Earth orbiting around the Sun.
- The third scene is a depiction of a red race car, which you can also move around and stop using your arrow keys and space bar, respectively.
