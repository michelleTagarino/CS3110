# Interactive Mouse
This one gives me a laugh. The goal of this assignment was to create a JavaFX project where you had to create a bunch of shapes, make a random face out of them, and then move the face around either with arrow keys or randomly across the window. I liked it though, pretty cool project. Brought out my artistic side.
